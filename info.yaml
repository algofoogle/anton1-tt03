# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Multiply two 8-bit numbers, get a 16-bit result."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This very simple design streams in two 8-bit numbers (split into nibbles) and then streams out their 16-bit product (split into bytes).
            
      Following a synchronous reset, each rising clock edge represents a new step in a sequence of 6 steps:
      (1) load first value's high nibble; (2) load first value's low nibble; (3) load second value's high nibble; (4) load second value's low nibble;
      (5) present high byte of product result at output; (6) present low byte of product result at output.

      It then repeats this sequence.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project:
  how_to_test:  |
      After synchronous reset, expect `result` output to be 0. Set `nibble` to a value of your choice, then pulse the clock. Repeat 3 more times.

      Then pulse the clock 2 more times, each time expecting to get a byte at the output `result`.
